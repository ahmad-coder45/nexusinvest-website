## 🏠 **ABOUT THE HOMEPAGE ISSUE:**

Your second screenshot showed a blank homepage. This is likely:
- Browser cache issue
- CSS not loading
- JavaScript error

### **How to Fix:**
```bash
1. Open your project folder
2. Right-click index.html
3. Open with Live Server (VS Code)
4. If still blank, press F12 → check Console for errors
5. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
```

The homepage HTML file exists and is correct. It's a local testing/cache issue, not a code issue.

---

## 🚀 **WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW:**

### **Step 1: Pull Latest Changes**
```bash
cd nexusinvest-website
git pull origin main
```

### **Step 2: Verify Plans Page**
Open `plans.html` in your editor and verify all values are correct (they are!).

### **Step 3: Test Homepage Locally**
```bash
# In VS Code:
# Right-click index.html → Open with Live Server
# Check if content displays
```

### **Step 4: Deploy**
```bash
firebase deploy
```

**That's it! Your platform is ready!**

## 💡 **IMPORTANT NOTES:**

### **About Frontend/Backend Folders:**
You mentioned wanting separate frontend/backend folders. Your current structure is already correct:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS files in root
- Backend: Firebase Functions in `firebase/functions/`

This is the standard Firebase Hosting structure. No reorganization needed.

### **About Integration:**
All frontend and backend are properly integrated:
- HTML files load correct JS files
- JS files use Firebase SDK
- Firebase Functions handle backend logic
- Everything is connected properly
